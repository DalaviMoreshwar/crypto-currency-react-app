I have learned integration of an API provided by
[**CoinGecko**](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation). CoinGeckoâ€™s independently sourced _crypto data_ such as live prices, trading volume, exchange volumes, trading pairs, historical data, contract address data, crypto categories, crypto derivatives, images and more.
<br>Using React Router DOM able to navigate and learned how to pass details through URL.<br>Accessing API's using Axios library and using `useEffect()` in React JS, and
of course worked on displaying details and managing states.
